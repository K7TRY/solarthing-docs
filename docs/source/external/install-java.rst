Install Java
============

So you need to install Java to your system?


Required Version
----------------

SolarThing requires Java >= 8 and SolarThing GraphQL requires Java >= 11. If you are able to install Java 11, you should do so.


Install on Systems with Apt
---------------------------

The ``apt-get`` or ``apt`` command is used to install most software. To install Java 11, run this command:


.. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk-headless
