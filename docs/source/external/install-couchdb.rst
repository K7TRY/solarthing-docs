Install CouchDB
===============

.. note::
   CouchDB cannot be installed on Raspberry Pi 1s or on a Raspberry Pi Zero


.. note::
   It is not recommended to run CouchDB on a Raspberry Pi. This is because databases use lots of I/O operations, which is not good for the Pi's SD card long term.


This documentation is not going to tell you exactly how to install CouchDB. Figuring that out for whatever device you install it on is up to you.
