Configuring a database
========================

OK, now the program is working! However, right now the only thing the program is doing is showing us data. We want to upload the data to a database.

If you don't already know which database you want to set up, take a look at :doc:`database-and-display`.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :caption: Databases

   config/couchdb
   config/influxdb1
   config/influxdb2

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :caption: Continued

   configuration-edit-base-json


If you do not wish to configure a database at this time, skip to :doc:`configuration-continued`
